      <description>Node was a machine on Hackthebox a few years ago and was later put up on Vulnhub. I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently got around to doing it, but it was really rather interesting with its full-stack Javascript environment, something that is becoming increasingly common with the likes of NodeJS, and I found it quite enjoyable. In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more fun boxes on Hackthebox, and I encourage you to give it a go if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.</description>

      <description>Another enjoyable CTF, eLection: 1 promises to be an OSCP-like VM with medium level difficulty. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a straightforward box, but nonetheless a good excuse to sharpen your skills.
Enumeration Lets see what ports are open with nmap -T4 -A 192.168.123.132:

      <description>Cybersploit 2 is a fun boot2root on VulnHub. It&amp;rsquo;s quite an enjoyable box, and whilst user is really rather easy, getting root is quite an interesting affair (at least I found it to be).
Initial foothold Let&amp;rsquo;s scan the box and see what ports are open with nmap -sC -sV -p- 192.168.123.131:
